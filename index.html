        <h3> Featured Experiences: </h3>
        <p> Some of my favorite adventures include swimming in the Red Sea in Aqabah, exploring the busy streets of Amman, and spending time in Irbid with family. I also had the chance to visit Lebanon, where I enjoyed the food and the mountain views. More recently, I came to North Carolina and visited both Raleigh and Charlotte, which gave me a whole new perspective on life in the United States. </p>
